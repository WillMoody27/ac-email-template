## Design Process

The design process started in Figma, where low-fidelity wireframes were created to establish a structured layout. Prototyping the design allowed refinement of:

- Visual hierarchy to ensure important information stands out
- Spacing and typography for improved readability and aesthetic appeal
- Brand consistency using colors and layout elements that align with email best practices

Once the design was finalized, it was translated into HTML and CSS, ensuring every component maintained its structure across different email clients.

## Development Approach

This email template is built using HTML tables for layout consistency across different email clients. Inline CSS is used to maintain a consistent appearance, as many email providers strip out external stylesheets. 

To ensure responsiveness, media queries are included, allowing the template to adapt to mobile screens. The structure and code were tested using Litmus and Putsmail for compatibility with different devices and email clients.
